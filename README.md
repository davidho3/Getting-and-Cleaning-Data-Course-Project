# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

The code run_analysis.R assumes all data files are unzipped, and located in the folder "UCI Har Dataset". The URL for the dataset can e found here:

The code extracts the mean and standard deviation for each measurement, and relabels the data set with descriptive variable names.
An independent tidy dataset named "tidy_dataset.txt" is produced which contains the average of each variable for each activity and subject.
